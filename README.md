# Assignment1
My project is based on the influence basketball in the United States (NBA) has had on other countries in the past years. I intend to show this effectively using visualisation techniques.I also intend to show the countries besides the United States that have players currently playing in the NBA.

Option1 displays a trend graph of the no pInternational players that have played or is playing in the NBA
When one of the ball is clicked the ball bounces.Cool right?

Option 2 displays a piechart of the countries
